    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheet ( English : Cascading Style Sheet ) is a style language ( English : Style sheet language [ * ] ) that describes how markup language is actually displayed [1] ,
     HTML and Mainly used in XHTML, but can also be used in XML. It is a W3C standard, and has a high degree of freedom when defining layout and style . The default file name [2] is style.css.
     If the markup language (ex: HTML ) is in charge of the body of the website, CSS can be said to be in charge of decoration, like clothes and accessories. 
     In other words, you can decorate it like a completely different website by leaving the HTML structure the same and changing the CSS file.
