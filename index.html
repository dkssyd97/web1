    <h2>WEB</h2>
    <p>The World Wide Web (WWW, W3) refers to a global information sharing system that allows people to share information through computers connected to the Internet.
     It is often simply referred to as the Web . This term is often used synonymously with the Internet, but strictly speaking, they are different concepts. 
     The web, like e-mail, is just a 'service' that operates on the Internet communication network. However, since 1993, the Web has occupied an absolute position in the Internet structure.
     It also refers to a transmission method of exchanging pictures and text on the Internet using the HTTP protocol , hypertext , and HTML format.
