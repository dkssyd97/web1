    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript ( English : JavaScript ) is an object-based script programming language. This language is primarily used within web browsers and has the ability to access built-in objects in other applications. 
    It is also used in server programming, such as runtime environments such as Node.js. 
    JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation under the name Mocha and later as LiveScript, which ultimately became JavaScript.
